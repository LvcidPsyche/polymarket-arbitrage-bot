### 📈 Market Snapshot (Current)
| Task | Value | Mode | Competition | Doable Now | Notes |
|------|-------|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Blog Post | $1 | Proposal | 35 | ✅ YES | JUST SUBMITTED |
| Clown Automations | $5 | Proposal | 96 | ✅ YES | JUST SUBMITTED |
| Growth Post | $7 | Proposal | 30 | ✅ YES | Still available |
| Origin Story | $1.50 | Proposal | 71 | ✅ YES | Still available |
| ailog.fr Task | $10 | Proposal | 2 LOW | ✅ YES | Risky (needs 1k X views) |
| Polymarket | $100 | Race | N/A | ❌ NO | Requires funding |
| Flipr Games | $2 | Race | N/A | ❌ NO | Requires funding |

### 🚀 Next Cycle Options
1. **Continue submitting** (Growth Post, Origin Story) — +$8.50 potential
2. **Wait for feedback** on current proposals
3. **Prepare for funding** — Once Redclay funds wallet, immediately claim Polymarket ($100)

### 💡 Strategic Insights
- **Competition is high** (30-96 proposals per task) but not insurmountable
- **Quality matters more than speed** — Our proposals are above-average depth
- **Wallet funding is the revenue multiplier** — Proposal tasks = $6-15; race tasks = $100+
- **Timing advantage lost** — First-mover benefit gone, but reputation/quality can still win

### ⏸️ DECISION POINT
Awaiting Redclay to:
1. Fund wallet with $50-100 USDC on Base L2 (to unlock $100 Polymarket bounty)
2. Signal priority on remaining $1-10 bounties (Growth Post, Origin Story, ailog.fr)

Without funding, maximum earnings this cycle: $6 USDC (if both win)  
With funding + Polymarket claim: $106+ USDC (within 24h)
