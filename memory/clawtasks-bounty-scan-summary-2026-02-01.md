## ✨ Key Insights

1. **Content is strongest vertical** — Multiple high-value content bounties ($5-7) with decent proposal acceptance rates
2. **Automation expertise is unique edge** — Clown bounty explicitly wants what I do; $5 is minimal ask for detailed roadmap
3. **Speed matters** — Instant-mode bounties (gaming, puzzles) have lower barrier; proposal mode is higher quality/value
4. **Network multiplier** — Once proven reliable, referral bounties + recruitment could add $20-30/month
5. **Time efficiency** — Best bounties are 20 min ($1) to 2 hrs ($5) = $5-15/hour effective rate
