Implementing these techniques can reduce your API spending by 50-95% depending on your use case. 1. Model Selection Strategy Choosing the right model for each task is the most impactful cost decision you can make. Don't default to the most capable model—match the model to your task complexity. Current Pricing (per million tokens): Model Input Output Best For Claude Haiku 4.5 $1 $5 High-volume, simple tasks Claude Sonnet 4.5 $3 $15 Balanced performance Claude Opus 4.5 $5 $25 Complex reasoning Model Selection Decision Framework: • Use Haiku 4.5 for: Classification, extraction, simple Q&A, content moderation, formatting tasks, FAQ responses, basic summarization, and high-volume pipelines • Use Sonnet 4.5 for: Code generation, complex analysis, multi-step reasoning, content creation, and most production workloads • Use Opus 4.5 only for: Mission-critical decisions, complex multi-file refactoring, architectural planning, and tasks where errors are very expensive Key insight: Haiku 4.5 achieves 90% of Sonnet's performance on many tasks at 1/3 the cost. Start with Haiku and only upgrade if quality is insufficient. 2. Prompt Caching (Up to 90% Savings) Prompt caching stores repeated portions of your prompts so they don't need to be reprocessed. This is one of the most powerful cost-saving features available. How Caching Pricing Works: • Cache write (first request): 1.25x base input price (5-minute TTL) or 2x (1-hour TTL) • Cache read (subsequent requests): 0.1x base input price (90% savings!) • Break-even point: Just 2 API calls using the same cached content Implementation Example: curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \ -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \ -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \ -d '{ "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "system": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Your long system prompt or context here...", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"} }], "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Your question"}] }' Best Practices for Caching: • Minimum cacheable size: 1,024 tokens (4,096 for Haiku 4.5) • Place static content at the beginning of your prompt (tools → system → messages) • Cache order matters: tools are processed first, then system, then messages • Maximum 4 cache breakpoints per request • Default TTL is 5 minutes, refreshed on each use. Use 1-hour TTL for less frequent access patterns What to Cache: • System prompts and instructions that don't change between requests • Large context documents (PDFs, codebases, reference materials) • Tool definitions • Few-shot examples • Conversation history prefixes in chat applications 3. Batch API (50% Discount) The Batch API processes requests asynchronously with up to 24-hour turnaround in exchange for a 50% discount on all tokens. Ideal Use Cases: • Bulk content generation (reports, summaries, marketing copy) • Large-scale data processing and classification • Overnight batch jobs • Non-time-sensitive analysis tasks • Training data preparation Combining Batch + Caching (Up to 95% Savings): The Batch API discount stacks with prompt caching. For workloads with repeated context processed in batches, you can achieve extraordinary savings: • Standard input: $3/MTok (Sonnet 4.5) • Batch only: $1.50/MTok (50% off) • Cache read only: $0.30/MTok (90% off) • Batch + Cache read: $0.15/MTok (95% off) 4. Token Optimization Strategies Reduce Input Tokens: • Write concise system prompts—every token costs money ◦ Remove redundant instructions ◦ Use clear, direct language instead of verbose explanations • Truncate or summarize conversation history instead of passing full histories • Only include relevant context—don't dump entire documents if only sections are needed • Compress few-shot examples to their essential elements Reduce Output Tokens: • Set appropriate max_tokens limits—if you only need a short answer, don't allow 4,000 tokens • Instruct the model to be concise in your prompt • Request structured output (JSON) to avoid verbose prose • Use stop sequences to cut off responses at the right point Extended Thinking Considerations: Extended thinking tokens are billed as output tokens. When enabled, the model uses additional tokens for internal reasoning. Start with the minimum budget (1,024 tokens) and increase only if needed. Only use extended thinking for genuinely complex problems that benefit from deeper reasoning. 5. Cost-Efficient Architecture Patterns Dynamic Model Routing: Route requests to different models based on complexity. This is one of the most effective strategies for production systems: 1. Classify incoming requests by complexity (can use Haiku for this) 2. Route simple queries to Haiku, complex ones to Sonnet 3. Reserve Opus for edge cases flagged as requiring maximum capability 4. Implement confidence thresholds to escalate when needed Multi-Model Orchestration: Use Sonnet for planning and orchestration, then dispatch subtasks to multiple Haiku instances running in parallel. This approach gives you Sonnet-quality planning with Haiku-level costs for execution. Response Caching Layer: Implement your own application-level cache for common queries: • Cache identical or semantically similar queries • Use embedding similarity to match near-duplicate questions • Set appropriate TTLs based on how often your data changes 6. Monitoring and Cost Control Track Your Usage: • Log all API calls with token counts (input, output, cache reads/writes) • Monitor cost per feature/endpoint to identify expensive operations • Set up alerts for unusual spending patterns • Review the usage object in API responses to verify caching is working Usage Response Example: { "usage": { "input_tokens": 21, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 188086, "output_tokens": 393 } } High cache_read_input_tokens relative to input_tokens indicates caching is working effectively. 7. Quick Wins Checklist Implement these immediately for fast cost reductions: • Switch simple tasks to Haiku (immediate 3-5x savings) • Enable prompt caching for any repeated system prompts or context </file>

assistant: 📊 **CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE: Claude API Cost Optimization Guide Received**

This is **highly valuable** for optimizing my current operations! Let me immediately implement these cost-saving strategies:
user: [Telegram J (@deadredfred) id:5677911315 2026-02-01 06:56 UTC] Excellent. I have something for you. Here is an optimization guide provided by Claude opus 4.5 on how to minimize cost on the Claude api. Please review these suggestions and integrate these into our infrastructure. I also want you to create a repository with this information. Make it pretty and then post on molt book to attract attention. Once you have optimized infrastructure and completed this come back to me. The scheduled update at 1 am can be postponed until 1:30am
